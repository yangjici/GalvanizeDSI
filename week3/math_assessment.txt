** Probability **

1. The bias of a coin is 0.6 in favor of heads. What is the probability of flipping 
8 or more heads in 10 flips?

1- cdf(7, 10, 0.6, loc=0) = 0.1672898

2. You've found a secret admirer note on your desk, and don't know
who it might've come from but you know it must've been one of your 
three office mates:  Jack, John, or Jimmy.  
- As of yesterday, you thought it was twice as likely that Jimmy had a crush on you than John,
and that John and Jack were equally likely to have a crush on you.  
- However even if Jimmy liked you, you think there'd only be 5% he'd leave you a note.
- On the other hand, if Jack liked you there'd be a whopping 50% chance he'd leave you a note.
and if John liked you, there'd be a 20% chance he'd leave you a note. 

What's the probability that the note came from John?

PJimmy=0.5, PJohn = 0.25, PJack = 0.25

P(Note|Jim) = 0.05

P(Note|jack) = 0.5

P(Note|John) = 0.2

P(Note) =0.2 (law of total probability)

P(John|Note) = P(Note|John)*PJohn/ P(note) = 0.0625

** Statistics **

Below are the total number of log-ins for 20 different randomly selected users from 2014:
    [10, 25, 12, 35, 14, 18, 16, 15, 22, 10, 9, 11, 49, 20, 15, 9, 18, 19, 20, 20]

3. What is the sample mean?

18.35

4. What is the sample variance?

91.5

5. If we randomly select another user from 2014, what is the probability that he/she 
has more than 15 log-ins?  

0.55


6. Sales targets weren't met last year.  The sales department asserts that on average, 
there were only 10 log-ins per user, however the web team thinks there were more.  
Set up a frequentist hypothesis test and compute a p-value based on your data.  

Null: The average is 10 or less logins per user

Alternative: The average is greater than 10 logins per use

Alpha = 0.05

Using t-test of one sample compare to mu of 10, we found p-value ~ 0.001

We reject null hypothesis with 95 percent confidence and conclude that that average user log in is greater than 10 per user.



7. A major charity organization is interested to see if changing the mission 
statement on the website increases donations. As a pilot study, they randomly 
show 1 of 10 newly drawn up mission statements to each user that comes to the site.  
As such, you set up 10 separate hypothesis tests, each testing whether or not 
there was an increase in donations. What adjustments would you make to account for the 10 tests? 


I would make bonferoni adjustment to each individual confidence to the confidence level of 1 - alpha/10, alpha being the p-value that is not specified in the question

**  Modeling **

8.  Generally, when we increase the flexiblity or complexity of the model, what happens to bias?  What about variance?

Increasing the complexity of the model leads to lower bias and higher variance

What do we expect to happen to the training error?  What about the test error?

We would expect training error to decrease and test error to increase

9.  You have two models:
Model 1:   Salary ~ Occupation + Height + Gender
Model 2:   Salary ~ Occupation + Region + Height + Gender

Name 2 appropriate ways to compare these two models.

Cross validation of the model’s performance on training and validation data using the following criteria:

1.The general linear f test

2. Compare model difference in AIC, BIC, Mallows Cp depending on whether we want to be more conservative or less conservative (using the model for descriptive or predictive reasons)

For descriptive purpose we can be more conservative while for predictive purpose we want to favor parsimony. 


Name 1 inappropriate way to compare these two models.  

Using the model with larger R^2 does not reflect the model’s merit or it’s predictive performance
