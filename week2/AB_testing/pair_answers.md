Part 1

* we can not conclude that attending meet ups cause sellers to generate more revenues because there might exist confounding factors (time, characteristic of sellers who attend meetups vs those who doesnt) that contribute to the differences in sale.

* recruit a large sample of sellers who never went to the meet up before, randomly assign the sellers to two groups, one group will undergo the treatment of going through the meetup while the baseline group does not go to the meetup. then we set up the meet up time at the beginning of the month, we will track the revenue of the two group for the duration of the month. we will collect the differences of revenue between previous sales and after meet up sales for each seller and see if there is a significant difference between treatment group and control group. Using a significance level of 5 percent

* the purpose of A/B testing allow us to eliminate confounding factors in the post hoc analysis of existing data by giving us control to eliminate bias in the groups

We will set a new server that runs a new recommendation engine that utilizes latest recommendation technique.  

We will set up a redirection logic on our existing website to randomly assign users to either the new server or the existing production server with the the old recommendation engine.

After collecting enough data from both servers we will then compare overall CRT rates for each engine.
