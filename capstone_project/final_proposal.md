##DSI Capstone Project Final Proposal


#Implementing personality to music recommendation system


In this project I would like to build a music recommender system using collaborative filtering algorithm is as well as song similarity. For user to user similarity, I plan on using additional information regarding the user's personality in terms of big 5. I plan on comparing the performance of baseline recommender model without additional personality against the model taking acount of user personality. 


 The idea of using users’ personality traits as a general model for music recommendation is based on a result from a sound empirical research. In which researchers were able to identify relationships between users’ personality and their behavior, preferences, and needs. In addition, previous research on the links between musical preferences and the Big Five personality traits has supported that preferences are indicative of explicit personal characteristics. The hypothesis has shown consistent trends across studies and cultures.

My work work contributes to new ways to infer personality-based user models, and show how these models can be implemented in a music recommender system to positively contribute to the user experience.

Main data source: research data from 'The Song Is You: Preferences for Musical Attribute Dimensions Reflect Personality' by David M. Greenberg.

Additional data source is from mypersonality.org, a once popular facebook app that allow the users to take personality quizes and also have information of their last.fm usage. http://mypersonality.org/wiki/doku.php?id=download_databases

I have procured the data from the author and I am currently in the stage of thinking about the ways I could incorporate the personality data in building the recommendation system.
