##DSI Capstone Project Preliminary proposal


#Proposal one: lets add personality to music recommendation system

Applications are getting increasingly interconnected. Although the interconnectedness provide new ways to gather information about the user, not all user information is ready to be directly implemented in order to provide a personalized experience to the user. Therefore, a general model is needed to which users’ behavior, preferences, and needs can be connected to.

In this project I would like to work on a personality-based music recommender system in which we use users’ personality traits as a general model, based on a result from a sound empirical research. We identified relationships between users’ personality and their behavior, preferences, and needs. In addition, previous research on the links between musical preferences and the Big Five personality traits has supported that preferences are indicative of explicit personal characteristics. The hypothesis has shown consistent trends across studies and cultures.

In general, people high on extraversion and agreeableness prefer pop, soundtrack, religious, soul, funk, electronic, and dance genres and those high in openness to experience prefer blues, jazz, classical, and folk genres (Rentfrow & McDonald, 2009).

My work work contributes to new ways to infer personality-based user models, and show how these models can be implemented in a music recommender system to positively contribute to the user experience.


Main data source: research data from 'The Song Is You: Preferences for Musical Attribute Dimensions Reflect Personality' by David M. Greenberg.

Next step: conducting further research on personality and music preference, in the stage of reaching out to author for research data - received confirmation from the authors

#Proposal two: basic conventional uncreative music recommender

Description: Using a combination of collaborative filtering and lyric-based similarity to build a basic music recommendation system from scratch. I will be presenting my work using presentation. The music recommender is unsupervised, hard to verify results, already have been repeated multiple times, but the value of practicing data science is strong.

#Proposal three:

In this project, I would like to build a real time, pricing recommendation tool for airbnb hotels. Since sometimes the automatic pricing tool just doesnt take account of the prices of houses around the area, and also doesnt take account of different holidays and festivals.

I would scrape the prices and information of the houses around my parent's home and recommend them with competitive pricing based on a wide range of criteria.

The project is going to be a API crawler that scrapes data from airbnb API and funnels it through a automated processing program pipeline/model that generates recommendation range for the prices in the next week or month. The function can be run as frequently as need to make price recommendation.
